#Poultry Watch

Poultry Watch Consumer Guide for Walmart is a web app designed for Walmart customers to easily communicate their preferences on poultry meat items sold at their local store.

##Overview

How does a giant like Walmart listen to your opinions on how your chicken is raised? How do they satisfy all of their customers when we are each a unique snowflake with our own unique preferences? How do they adjust in order to communicate their values to their unique consumer? Enter Poultry Watch.

##Recommendation Engine [currently building 10/9/15]

Poultry Watch creates a community where real conversation about our meat products come from, and where you can get recommendations about chicken products based on:

-Non-personalized summary statistics (average product rating/review)

-Ephemeral personalization (users that shop for one item also commonly buy another item)

-Persistent personalization based on preferences (the user homepage and recommended items)

Users will be able to:
